# Physics properties for example_crate.g3d model
# Used by ModelAssetManager to provide buoyancy data to WorldObjects

# Volume displacement in cubic meters (how much water the object displaces when fully submerged)
volumeDisplacement=0.125

# Weight in kilograms
weight=15.0

# Whether this object floats by default (optional - calculated from density if not specified)
# density = weight / volumeDisplacement = 15.0 / 0.125 = 120 kg/m³
# Since water density is ~1000 kg/m³, this object will float (density < 1000)
floats=true

# Example calculations:
# - Buoyant force in water (1000 kg/m³): F = 0.125 * 1000 * 9.81 = 1226.25 N
# - Weight force: F = 15.0 * 9.81 = 147.15 N  
# - Net upward force: 1226.25 - 147.15 = 1079.1 N (object floats strongly)
